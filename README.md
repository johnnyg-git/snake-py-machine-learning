# snake-py-machine-learning
A remake of my first game (Snake) but with a twist. It now has machine learning! 
I've never done this before so it's honestly pretty badly made but I've really enjoyed the process.
This uses NEAT.

# Training
If you would like to train your own version of this then just edit the config file to your likings and run it. The script will go through until it reaches the fitness threshold or has gone through 200 generations (you can change this in the script) and will then save the trained data.

# Running the trained version
I have included some a genome from 10 minutes of training. The genome had to reach a fitness of 250 before saving and I believe it got atleast 300. It will still crash into itself quite often because it's only from 10 minutes but it should give you a good example of what this is capable of.
